<h1>By George Pope Morris</h1>
<p>'Twas in the flush of summer-time,</p>
<p>	  Some twenty years or more,</p>
<p>When Ernest lost his way, and crossed</p>
<p>	  The threshold of our door.</p>
<p>I'll ne'er forget his locks of jet,</P>
<p>	  His brow of Alpine snow,</P>
<p>His manly grace of form and face,</P>
<p>	  Some twenty years ago.</p>

<P>The hand he asked I freely gave--</P>
<p>	  Mine was a happy lot,</P>
<p>Mine was a happy lot,</p>
<p>	  Within my father's cot.</P>
<p>The faith he spoke he never broke:</p>
<p>	  His faithful heart I know;</p>
<p>And well I vow I love him now</P>
<p>	  As twenty years ago.</p>
